## M4V vs MP4 - What's the Main Difference

_Is the [difference between m4v and mp4](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/) just a matter of file extensions? Is m4v just mp4 renamed as m4v? My understanding is that generally, the existence of the m4v extension is simply to force iTunes to open the file by default._

Put it simply, M4V is very close to MP4\. There’s no difference in file size and video quality. Both M4V and MP4V are based on MPEG-4(Moving Picture Expert Group-4). But the difference between MP4 and M4V is far more than a matter of file extensions. 

From the first part "what is M4V", we know that M4V format, originally designed for iTunes to push users to buy songs videos, is supported mainly by Apple products, but MP4 format developed to achieve faster loading and better quality is widely accepted by most devices and players. Also, M4V files may be protected by using Apple’s FairPlay DRM copyright protection.
