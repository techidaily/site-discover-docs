Puzzled about M4V format? You are not alone in such confusion. Here's a quick yet complete lowdown on M4V format - what is M4V, main differences between M4V and MP4, M4V converter, etc. Everything about M4V file format is talked here. 

##  What is M4V?

Developed by Apple Inc., M4V file format is a video container format. Big advantage of M4V is that it keeps a good balance between file size and video quality as MP4 video format does. It is worth mentioning that M4V is always used by Apple to encode music videos, TV shows, movies etc. Originally, M4V, under protection, was only played on a computer via iTunes, but it is accepted by more media players now, thanks to the growing popularity of Apple portable devices. Detailed information about what M4V format is doesn't end here, keep reading. 

##  What Devices Support M4V File Format

As being developed by Apple to protect copyright, M4V is only supported by a certain type of Apple products, say, iPhone, iPad, iPod, Apple TV. M4V file can not be played on Android mobile devices. That is to say, M4V file will be involved in video compatibility issues easily for tons of devices. In this case, M4V DRM removal yet converter is badly needed to [remove iTunes DRM from M4V video](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/) and convert M4V to unprotected MP4.

## M4V vs MP4 - What's the Main Difference

_Is the [difference between m4v and mp4](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/) just a matter of file extensions? Is m4v just mp4 renamed as m4v? My understanding is that generally, the existence of the m4v extension is simply to force iTunes to open the file by default._

Put it simply, M4V is very close to MP4\. There’s no difference in file size and video quality. Both M4V and MP4V are based on MPEG-4(Moving Picture Expert Group-4). But the difference between MP4 and M4V is far more than a matter of file extensions. 

From the first part "what is M4V", we know that M4V format, originally designed for iTunes to push users to buy songs videos, is supported mainly by Apple products, but MP4 format developed to achieve faster loading and better quality is widely accepted by most devices and players. Also, M4V files may be protected by using Apple’s FairPlay DRM copyright protection.
