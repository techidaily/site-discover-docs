## Eco-Friendly Skullcandy EcoBuds at Just $40 - A Comprehensive Review of Their Sound Quality

### Key Takeaways

* Eco-friendly earbuds with less plastic and heavy metals offer a sustainable option for all budgets.
* Reasonably priced at $40 with up to 8 hours of listening time on one charge.
* While lacking software support, they provide touch control sound customization.

 The [Skullcandy EcoBuds](https://www.amazon.com/Skullcandy-Wireless-Battery-Free-Microphone-Bluetooth/dp/B0CTD7K2ZT?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2004158&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fskullcandy-ecobuds-review%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Authority) have an obvious mission: to make a highly produced product like earbuds better for the environment. However, even if that goal doesn't sway you, a cheap price and compact size might put these on your radar.

##  What Makes Skullcandy EcoBuds So Eco-Friendly?

 These earbuds were designed with 65% certified recycled plastic and 57% less heavy metal compared to most standard earbuds on the market. This means that Skullcandy EcoBuds are produced with fewer wasteful materials and have a smaller carbon footprint.

 This affects how you charge your EcoBuds. The company removed the battery from the case and, instead, added a connected USB-C cable. Instead, the earbud case is designed to be plugged into your phone (computer or power adapter) via USB-C and charge your earbuds using your phone’s battery. A little bit different charging process than you may be used to.

 The minimalist case design does not have a cover, which may make you think twice about tossing it into your bag. The earbuds are held in the case with magnets, so they aren’t at risk of falling out, but the case won’t keep your earbuds clean from dust and whatever else they might encounter when they’re being stored.

##  Eco-Friendly Is Great, But How Does It Sound?

 In terms of audio quality, the Skullcandy EcoBuds were on par with other earbuds at this lower price point; not too impressive, but certainly acceptable. The sound is vibrant, but the lows were a lot richer than the higher register notes. The bass can be emphasized even more with the EQ modes available on the EcoBuds. Phone calls and sound from various apps had consistent and clear quality.

 While there isn't any ANC mode for these earbuds, the passive noise-canceling on the Skullcandy EcoBuds is impressive. The shape of the earbuds does a great job of blocking out general ambient noise, and even loud noises are reduced. I found it to be effective for use on public transportation, or even just to help muffle the sound of a snoring partner.

##  There’s No Software, Which Can Be Good or Bad

 Depending on how you’re accustomed to using your earbuds, a lack of software could be a good or bad thing. On the plus side, there’s one less app to download and manage on your phone. But that also means there’s no app to help you find a missing earbud, track battery life, or make adjustments to the settings.

 The Skullcandy EcoBuds do offer a bit of sound customization, however. Using simple touch controls, there are three preset listening modes that you can rotate through: Music, Bass Boost, and Podcast. However, the Bass Boost seems to be merely lowering the volume of the treble in the EQ, which isn’t the same thing. The Music and Podcast modes sounded extremely similar to me, so I used the Music mode 90% of the time.

##  8 Hours of Listening on One Charge

 While the charging process of the Skullcandy EcoBuds might be a little different with its USB-C cord siphoning energy from your phone’s battery, it’s not a huge sacrifice. If you only charge the EcoBuds for 10 minutes, you’ll have 2 hours of listening time.

 With a full charge, the EcoBuds should last for a solid 8 hours. I charged the earbuds to 100% and was able to use them sporadically for 5 days without needing to recharge. The earbuds also do a good job of retaining that charge even if they’ve been sitting around unused for a day or two, which makes them a great option for your gym bag. Not all earbuds are great for workouts, so check out this [list of earbuds for running](https://facebook-video-recording.techidaily.com/new-insiders-look-at-streaming-content-on-social-media-platforms-for-2024/) if you're looking for the best options for you.

##  Should You Buy the Skullcandy EcoBuds?

 If you value sustainable products, then the [Skullcandy EcoBuds](https://www.amazon.com/Skullcandy-Wireless-Battery-Free-Microphone-Bluetooth/dp/B0CTD7K2ZT?tag=hotoge-20&ascsubtag=UUhtgUeUpU2004158&asc%5Frefurl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.howtogeek.com%2Fskullcandy-ecobuds-review%2F&asc%5Fcampaign=Authority) are a worthy consideration. They offer all the standard features that you’d see with other earbuds in this price range, with a new approach to earbud charging with an integrated USB-C cable.

 However, if you expect nothing but the highest quality sound from your earbuds, you might not be satisfied with the EcoBuds. The EQ modes were not ground-breaking. You might need to shell out some more money to get better audio quality. Otherwise, the Skullcandy EcoBuds are a great choice for people on a budget. They could be great as ones to keep in your gym or travel bag!
