## iPhone Runs out of Storage Space - The Real Culprits You Don't Know

It's widely acknowledged even the 64/128GB iPhone will frustrate you at some critical moment such as software update due to the storage shortage. You are often told the **Apps such as Facebook and Instagram** you install on iPhone slowly drain away the amount of your iPhone storage, the **caches and cookies** secretly steal away the space on iPhone, and your accumulated **photos and music** are eating up your bare space. These are activities are blamed for iPhone storage full problem. 

However, they are not necessarily the main culprit. Frankly, **large video files** cause not enough space on iPhone. According to Apple, iPhone introduces SE/6S/7 (Plus) with the support of 4K 30fps video recording to Apple lovers who pursue higher resolution. Now the latest iPhone even shoots footage with resolution up to 40 60fps. However, there is a problem. iPhone makes every picture crisp and sharp, but at the sacrifice of a large amount of data needed to store on iPhone, even with the newest [HEVC](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/) supported to half file size for iPhone video compared with H.264\. But this doesn't really take the strain off iPhone storage.

![iPhone storage full problem](https://www.macxdvd.com/mobile/article-image/iphone-storage-full.jpg) 

 According to test, a minute iPhone 40 60fps video in HEVC takes up 400MB storage. That means 1h20min video in the same setting will theoretically use up the 32gb iPhone space, even with nothing installed on the smartphone. Of course, we don't mean you should not shoot any video footage. We mean you can either [compress the large video files](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/) to a smaller size or transfer video to your computer as backup before you delete them. Just follow the tutorial below to fix iPhone not enough storage problem. 

## Solution 1\. Transfer Media Files from iPhone to Computer as Backup and Delete Them

You understand that iTunes cannot transfer videos and photos that you have already synced to your iPhone back to the computer anymore. And there are constant [iTunes errors](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/) in the process of data backup. To free you from such embarrassment, here we recommend you to try **[MacX MediaTrans](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/)**, a fast iPhone Manager that allows to move the space-occupying iOS files like videos, photos, music, movies, etc to the hard drive on your computer. You are even allowed to delete these media files within the app in bulk without needing to do the same thing on your iPhone one by one. Therefore, it aids you to free up more space for your most important data.

Video compression is another great solution to fix iPhone out of storage problem. There are multiple apps that is able to [compress iPhone video](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/) for more storage space. But some cannot compress multiple video files, support limited format, come with annoying ads, or output the file whose quality is heavily compromised.

But **[MacX Video Converter Pro](https://tools.techidaily.com/macxdvd/products/)** resolves all the issues and manages to compress iPhone video as well as video from other sources, whether they are downloaded online, recorded with GoPro, or the rips from DVD movies.

**\- Bitrate:** Bitrate plays a decisive role to the video file size. Lower the bitrate will accordingly reduce file size for iPhone video. But for an enjoyable video watching experience, please cut down the bitrate by 20-30%.

**\- Frame rate:** Generally, video frame rate is suggested to keep it default. Any frame rate lower than 30fps will come with mosaic, choppy and lead to video playback problem. 

**Step 4:** Click RUN to begin the iPhone video compression. With GPU acceleration powered by Intel, Nvidia and AMD, any video converting will be processed fast. Then you can sync the compressed video to your iPhone and notice more storage space is spared for your iPhone.

## Other iPhone Storage Releasing Suggestions

1\. Go to iPhone settings > Photos & Camera > uncheck iCloud Photo Library to avoid iCloud or iTunes filling your iPhone space from backups.

2\. Go to Settings > Photos & Camera > disable Keep Normal Photo. This will prevent your Photos from occupying much waste space on your iPhone. 

3\. Delete the conversations, cookies, caches, related videos, pictures or so in iMessages, Facebook, YouTube, Whatsapp, Safari, or other frequently used apps to release more space for your iPhone. 

4\. Remove unnecessary apps and just keep the essential ones. This will solve iPhone storage problem to some degree.
