title: "[Teacher]: The Sentence Talks About Asynchronous Spectrum Access (ASA), Which Is a Method Used in Telecommunication for Spectrum Sharing. In the Context of Named Entity Recognition, It's Considered as an Entity and Thus Gets Labelled with B-Long at Its Beginning (Asynchronous) and I-Long for the Continuing Words (Spectrum, Access). The Acronym ASA Is Labeled as B-Short Since It Represents a Short Form of the Named Entity. All Other Words in the Sentence Do Not Represent Any Specific Entities, so They Are Labelled with 'O' Which Stands for 'Outside'."
